[00:00:00 - 00:00:08] Just a few months ago in June, pretty much every economist we spoke to expected the Bank of Canada would continue to cut interest rates.
[00:00:08 - 00:00:11] But the pace would be cautious and slow.
[00:00:11 - 00:00:17] Realistically, we're talking two or three of these quarter percentage point rate cuts in 2024.
[00:00:17 - 00:00:24] Our best guess is that it could take up to two years to ultimately get back down to around 3% of what the bank considers to be normal.
[00:00:24 - 00:00:28] Canada was actually one of the first countries to start cutting rates a few months ago.
[00:00:28 - 00:00:37] Because central bankers took a look around nationally and saw unemployment rising, GDP stalling, productivity at an all time low.
[00:00:37 - 00:00:40] And they decided the economy needed a boost.
[00:00:40 - 00:00:45] We need growth to start picking up. We need job creation to start picking up.
[00:00:45 - 00:00:51] But the plan was to take things slow because inflation still wasn't under control.
[00:00:51 - 00:00:53] Cutting rates risks driving inflation up.
[00:00:53 - 00:01:03] And according to the analysts we spoke to, there were concerns about cutting interest rates too fast and falling too far out of sync with the U.S.
[00:01:03 - 00:01:05] But this week, all of that changed.
[00:01:05 - 00:01:13] Headline inflation cooled to 2% in August, returning to the Bank of Canada's target for the first time since 2021.
[00:01:13 - 00:01:20] The Federal Reserve today delivering a jolt to the U.S. economy, a half percentage point cut to its benchmark rate.
[00:01:20 - 00:01:24] So our neighbor to the South cutting hard and fast.
[00:01:24 - 00:01:28] We wanted to know, would that push Canada to do the same?
[00:01:28 - 00:01:29] Let's go through.
[00:01:32 - 00:01:36] Interest rates in the U.S. have been stuck for a long time.
[00:01:36 - 00:01:44] The last time their interest rates went down, half the country was under a pandemic lockdown and Tiger King had just come out on Netflix.
[00:01:44 - 00:01:49] So this week's announcement that the Fed finally cut their key rate was big news.
[00:01:49 - 00:01:52] Not only in the U.S., but here in Canada too.
[00:01:52 - 00:01:58] U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has announced he will lower interest rates by a sizable half a percentage point.
[00:01:58 - 00:02:07] Economists say that this cut today in the U.S. will spur the Bank of Canada on to make further cuts to its interest rate.
[00:02:07 - 00:02:16] According to the analysts we spoke to, one of the reasons the Bank of Canada has so far been sticking to small quarter percentage point cuts,
[00:02:16 - 00:02:24] even as the economy teeters on the edge of a recession, is that falling too far out of sync with the U.S. can be a problem.
[00:02:24 - 00:02:31] There was an element that if the Americans didn't start cutting soon, we might actually see the Bank of Canada pause interest rates,
[00:02:31 - 00:02:41] not because we are working with them, but because we realize that by not moving in rough lock step with each other, it's actually bad monetary policy to go it alone.
[00:02:41 - 00:02:48] Yes, because consider how going it alone makes Canada a less attractive place to invest.
[00:02:48 - 00:02:49] I mean, just think about it.
[00:02:49 - 00:02:53] Interest rates going down means investors get less return.
[00:02:53 - 00:03:03] And if the U.S. keeps its rates high, all the more reason for investors to pull their money out of Canada, put it into the U.S., and the Canadian dollar gets weaker.
[00:03:03 - 00:03:09] Meaning everything we import from the U.S. costs us a lot more.
[00:03:09 - 00:03:12] One big issue with that, the price of gas.
[00:03:12 - 00:03:15] It's always priced in U.S. dollars.
[00:03:15 - 00:03:24] So a weaker Canadian dollar means Canadians get less gas for the same amount of money, which translates to higher prices at the pump.
[00:03:24 - 00:03:28] And higher prices at the pump contribute to a higher rate of inflation.
[00:03:28 - 00:03:34] The whole reason that the Bank of Canada was cutting interest rates was because they didn't fear inflation in the foreseeable future.
[00:03:34 - 00:03:41] But in fact, their interest rate cutting without the efforts of the Americans cutting theirs could in fact be counterproductive.
[00:03:41 - 00:03:46] Which brings us back to this week when the Fed went from cautious to aggressive.
[00:03:46 - 00:03:49] They didn't just cut a quarter percentage point as Canada has been doing.
[00:03:49 - 00:03:54] They cut half a percent and they made it clear that more cuts are coming.
[00:03:54 - 00:04:07] We know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level.
[00:04:07 - 00:04:15] Because now the U.S. is taking what I would deem the start of a very aggressive easing cycle, the Canadian dollar may strengthen.
[00:04:15 - 00:04:22] That does give the room then for the Bank of Canada to say, all right, now that we don't have to worry about inflation resurfacing through the exchange rate channel,
[00:04:22 - 00:04:26] then yeah, we have a little more room to go about cutting rates.
[00:04:26 - 00:04:38] But the other reason the Bank of Canada might want to mirror the U.S. rate cut is because of what that rate cut signals about the strength of the U.S. economy or the lack of it.
[00:04:38 - 00:04:40] People don't cut rates because the economy is doing great.
[00:04:40 - 00:04:43] They cut rates generally because the economy needs a little bit of a boost.
[00:04:43 - 00:04:47] Canadian exports are not doing all that well.
[00:04:47 - 00:04:52] The Canadian manufacturing sector is not in a strong, very strong position.
[00:04:52 - 00:04:55] You know, as they say, the U.S. sneezes, Canada catches a cold.
[00:04:55 - 00:04:56] So yeah, it's all connected.
[00:04:56 - 00:05:00] If the U.S. economy slows, so does Canada's.
[00:05:00 - 00:05:13] All the more reason for the Bank of Canada to speed up those rate cuts, something the governor of the Bank of Canada said just last week he would consider.
[00:05:13 - 00:05:15] Now, let's be clear.
[00:05:15 - 00:05:21] There's one number that matters most to the Bank of Canada, and that's the inflation rate.
[00:05:21 - 00:05:23] It doesn't matter how much the economy is struggling.
[00:05:23 - 00:05:28] If inflation is out of control, its main job is to bring it down.
[00:05:28 - 00:05:35] Two years ago, Canada's inflation rate was over 8 percent and the price of pretty much everything was surging fast.
[00:05:35 - 00:05:40] So the bank hiked interest rates again, again and again.
[00:05:40 - 00:05:45] Mortgages, car loans, lines of credit, they all got more expensive.
[00:05:45 - 00:05:49] And that meant people started spending less on everything else.
[00:05:49 - 00:05:59] Furniture, food, vacations, exercise equipment and less demand led to lower prices and eventually lower inflation.
[00:05:59 - 00:06:01] That was the plan and it worked.
[00:06:01 - 00:06:04] But did it work a little too well?
[00:06:04 - 00:06:12] They raised interest rates, hoping that would slow the economy and that would bring price growth inflation back down to Earth.
[00:06:12 - 00:06:19] And largely that has worked, but GDP has slowed to zero and the momentum is moving in all the wrong directions.
[00:06:19 - 00:06:31] Inflation is now down to 2 percent, but the bank seems increasingly worried that it might actually fall below that 2 percent target and push the economy into recession-like territory.
[00:06:31 - 00:06:34] This is another argument for the bank to speed up its cuts.
[00:06:34 - 00:06:42] We're still slowing the economy by how high interest rates are, but we don't need to slow it anymore because inflation is close to target.
[00:06:42 - 00:06:49] And we need to accelerate the pace to get to neutral because unemployment rate is rising in Canada.
[00:06:49 - 00:06:51] We don't want it to go any higher.
[00:06:51 - 00:06:55] Last month, the unemployment rate shot up to 6.6 percent.
[00:06:55 - 00:06:58] That's up from under 5 percent two years ago.
[00:06:58 - 00:07:07] And estimates show that the GDP only grew about half a percent in the third quarter compared to last year, well below the bank's forecast.
[00:07:07 - 00:07:13] All of this has economists predicting the next few cuts could be big ones.
[00:07:13 - 00:07:24] I do expect instead of 25 basis point cuts at their next two meetings, which I have right here, October 23rd is the next meeting and then December 11th,
[00:07:24 - 00:07:27] I expect to see 50 basis point cuts in both of those meetings.
[00:07:27 - 00:07:32] So lower by 100 basis points within the next, call it three months.
[00:07:32 - 00:07:41] And whether or not we see these super sized cuts, everyone we spoke to agreed barring big unforeseen changes to the economy,
[00:07:41 - 00:07:47] it will likely take a lot less time for us to get down to a neutral rate now.
[00:07:47 - 00:07:52] And that neutral rate could be even lower than we expected.
[00:07:52 - 00:08:00] I think we could possibly go lower, like we said, 250 to 225 by the end of 2025, which is stimulative for the economy.
[00:08:00 - 00:08:05] Now, important caveat to all of this, and it's something even the Bank of Canada acknowledges.
[00:08:05 - 00:08:17] If lowering mortgage rates causes some dramatic bounce back in the housing market, causing inflation to go back up, who knows how the bank will have to keep tweaking things in response.
[00:08:17 - 00:08:28] But for now, if you're looking to buy a home, if you hold a mortgage or a car loan, a line of credit, today's interest rate outlook probably comes as very welcome news.
